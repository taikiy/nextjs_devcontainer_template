This is a template project for building a Next.js app using VSCode + DevContainer. The project has the following installed:

* Next.js v14
* React v18
* TypeScript
* tailwindcss
* jest
* eslint
* prettier
* lint-staged
* simple-git-hooks

Once you clone the repository, run `npm run prepare` to install the git hooks. The `pre-commit` hook will run `eslint` and `prettier`, and the `pre-push` hook will run unit tests.

Install Docker Desktop if you haven't. Open the cloned folder in VSCode and you should be good to start writing your code!
